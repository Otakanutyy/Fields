            Welcome to our Medical Diagnosis Project
        </h1>
        <p>
        Our project aims to assist individuals in identifying possible diseases based on their symptoms. By entering your symptoms into our system, our AI-powered algorithm analyzes the information and provides you with a list of potential conditions that may be causing your discomfort.
            <br>
            <br>
            How It Works:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Enter Your Symptoms: Begin by typing in the symptoms you are experiencing. 
                    Our system allows you to input multiple symptoms for a more accurate diagnosis.
                </li>

                <li>
                    View Possible Diseases: After entering your symptoms, our AI system rapidly processes the data
                    and generates a list of potential diseases that match the symptoms you provided. Each potential
                    disease is accompanied by relevant information to help you understand its symptoms, causes, and 
                    potential treatments.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Find Doctors: In addition to providing information about possible diseases, our platform also suggests 
                    qualified doctors or specialists you can visit for further evaluation and treatment.
                    We believe in facilitating seamless access to healthcare professionals to ensure your well-being.
